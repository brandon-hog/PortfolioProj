        <p>Brandon was born in Bossier City, LA, but has little recollection of it because
            he was a part of a military family. Among all that changed while he had 
            to move around, video games were constant.
            Realizing his passion for computers and video games, he knew he wanted
            to pursue a career in that field. Currently, he is 
            pursuing a Bachelors degree of science at the University of West Florida for computer
            science. Aside from that, Brandon still loves to play video games, and also works as a 
            licensed Realtor in the state of Florida. **Make this better
